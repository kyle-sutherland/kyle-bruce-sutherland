## Kyle Sutherland

Hey, I'm a Freelance Web Developer. I enjoy working with Next.js, TanStack, TailWind and other 
cutting edge tools to craft beautiful, engaging front-end experiences and data-driven applications.

I am constantly building my toolbox and expanding my skillset. Recently I have been very active in 
studying the use of genarative software such as GPTs, LLMs, and other AI tools and their business 
applications. I am also very interested in the recent move toward simplicity in the web-dev world, 
so I have been working on some personal projects with the goal of gaining expertise with some newer 
tech stacks that use Go, Django and htmx with vanilla JavaScript. This portfolio showcases my 
professional work, and my blog offers a glimpse of some of my personal projects and hobbies as well.

## Kyle Sutherland

Hey, I'm a Freelance Web Developer. I enjoy working with Next.js, TanStack, TailWind, and other 
cutting-edge tools to craft beautiful, engaging front-end experiences and data-driven applications.
This portfolio showcases my professional work, and my blog offers a glimpse of some of my personal 
projects and hobbies.

As a freelance Web Developer, I strive to provide transparent service and build websites that 
accurately convey my clients' brands and showcase the value they can bring to their customers and 
partners. Utilizing modern serverless infrastructure and my own broad skillset, I am able to 
provide services at an affordable cost, from design conception and execution to deployment and 
maintenance.

I am constantly building my toolbox and expanding my skillset. Recently, I have been very active 
in studying the use of generative software such as GPTs, LLMs, and other AI tools and their 
business applications. I am also very interested in the recent move toward simplicity in the web 
development world. I have been working on some personal projects with the goal of gaining 
expertise with newer tech stacks that use Go, Django, and htmx with vanilla JavaScript.
